<h3 id="01-july-2016">01 July 2016</h3>

<p>Go kit started its life as just a talk at a small conference,
 and spent its first 18 months as a GitHub repo with lots of breaking changes.
(Sorry about that.)
Many design discussions took place, initially in RFCs, and then in GitHub issues,
 on the mailing list, and especially in the Slack channel.
While the code can capture the rationale and outcome of those discussions,
 it can&rsquo;t so easily capture the <em>context</em>: the conversations themselves, the alternatives,
 the pros and cons of all the decisions, the intended usage, the caveats.
And it&rsquo;s often these things that are the most valuable, especially to newcomers.</p>

<p>So, welcome to the new Go kit website!
The primary purpose will be to capture and document the context
 behind the decisions that shaped Go kit.
I&rsquo;ll record and keep supplementary information to help you
 understand and effectively apply Go kit in your organization.</p>

<p>Initially, I&rsquo;ll focus on building up <a href="/faq">an extensive FAQ</a>
 based on common questions and conversation in Slack, the mailing list, etc.
But no resource has proved nearly as useful as the examples,
 so I&rsquo;ve also ported <a href="/examples">the examples and tutorials from the repo</a>
 and will be adding to them as time goes on.</p>

<p>Happy programming üèå</p>
